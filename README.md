# Customer_Data_Collecting_System

I motivated to implement this project because of the Covid-19. Our implemented system streamlines the entry process by allowing customers to conveniently enter and save their information. With exclusive access granted to the shop owner, they can retrieve customer data for any desired date, enabling them to maintain accurate records and make informed decisions. This secure and user-friendly platform prioritizes data security and compliance with regulations, enhancing access control procedures for a smoother experience for customers and the owner alike.
